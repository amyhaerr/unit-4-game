# Objective:
To create a guessing game in which the user is shown only the number to guess and the numbers selected that are hidden by crystals.


# Directions:

1. This is a guessing game using numbers.
2. The player will guess with the unknown numbers.
3. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page with    
    hidden values between 1-12.
4. The player will be shown a random number, ranging from 19-120, at 
    the start of the game.
5. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount 
    of points to the player's total score.
6. The player wins the game if their total score matches the random 
    number.
7. The player loses the game if the total score goes over the random 
    number.
8. The game will then reset, displaying wins/losses without having  to  
   use refresh on the page.
